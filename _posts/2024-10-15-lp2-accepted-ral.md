I'm excited to share that our paper **Long-Term Human Trajectory Prediction using 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs** has been accepted at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)!

## Key Contributions

Our work addresses the challenge of predicting human trajectories over long time horizons (up to 60 seconds) in complex indoor environments. The main contributions include:

- **Novel approach** for long-term human trajectory prediction using 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs
- **LLM-based reasoning** about human-environment interactions to guide trajectory predictions
- **Probabilistic framework** based on continuous-time Markov Chains for multi-modal trajectory distributions
- **New dataset** of long-term human trajectories with human-object interaction annotations

## Results

Our approach achieves:
- 54% lower average negative log-likelihood compared to best non-privileged baselines
- 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error for 60s prediction horizon
